RADAR is a generalist vision-language model trained on over 400,000 contrast-enhanced abdominal CT examinations with 15 million anatomy-aware image–text pairs, learning directly from clinical reports without manual annotation. RADAR provides a scalable and versatile framework for radiology AI, demonstrating expert-level performance across both routine and complex clinical tasks.

## Setup

Create a conda environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n radar python=3.10
conda activate radar
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- > **Note:** The pinned package versions (e.g. `transformers==4.25`) follow the [LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS). Other versions may also work. -->

## HuggingFace

- The pre-trained checkpoints and supporting files are available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/radar-generalist).
- For convenience, we have provided the demo nifty, and predicted results in CSV format in this repo. The supporting files required for the inference demo and training can be downloaded from HuggingFace.
- Download via scripts: We provide two helper scripts under `download_scripts/` to fetch the required files from HuggingFace:

```bash
cd download_scripts
# Download model checkpoints and support files into ckpt/
python download_checkpoints.py
# Download auxiliary data (processed masks)
python download_auxiliary_data.py
```

## Zenodo

Code can also be archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/21271172).

| [Training](docs/TRAINING.md)     | Train RADAR/RADAR+ from scratch or fine-tune on MERLIN data; inference and evaluation are also included.                                                  |
| [Inference](docs/INFERENCE.md)   | 1. An inference demo with a radar pre-trained checkpoint on RAD-CT, and 2. Inference and evaluation of radar performance on the external MERLIN test set. |
| [Preprocess](docs/PREPROCESS.md) | Image/mask and radiology report preprocessing code, which can be used to process the MERLIN data or your own custom data.                                 |
